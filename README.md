# NPV-IRR-Calculator
Simple calculator for Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return

Just input the Cash flows (decimals are separated by ".") separated by line-breaks, inform the Rate of discount (Only used for NPV) and type how many decimal places the result must have. Empty values in the cash flows are invalid and will trigger an error. The default values for "Rate" and "Decimal places" are "0.1" and "6", respectively, and are used if you type any invalid values (0,1/A1A/" ") or let the fields empty.
